##📌 Concrete Strength Prediction

##📖 Overview
This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete using multiple regression models. The goal is to analyze various factors affecting concrete strength and build models that provide accurate predictions.

##📂 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple features influencing concrete strength, such as:
- Cement
- Blast Furnace Slag
- Fly Ash
- Water
- Superplasticizer
- Coarse Aggregate
- Fine Aggregate
- Age

##🛠️ Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features (if any)
- Feature scaling (Standardization, Normalization)

### Feature Engineering
- Creating new meaningful features from existing ones

### Model Training & Evaluation
Applied Machine Learning models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

Performance Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²) Score

📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy using [best performing model]
- Comparative evaluation of different models
- Insights into key factors affecting concrete strength
