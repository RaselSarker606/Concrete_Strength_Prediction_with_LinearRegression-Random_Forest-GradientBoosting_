# 📌 Classifying The Credit Scores
 

## 📖 Overview  
This project focuses on **credit score classification** using **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to classify individuals based on their credit scores, helping financial institutions assess risk and make informed lending decisions.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains various financial and demographic attributes related to credit scores. Key features include:  
- **Income**: Annual income of the individual  
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Debt compared to income  
- **Credit History Length**: Duration of credit activity  
- **Number of Open Accounts**: Active credit accounts  
- **Late Payment History**: Previous delays in payments  
- **Credit Score Category**: Good, Fair, Poor  

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Feature scaling (Standardization, Normalization)  
2. **Handling Class Imbalance**  
   - Techniques like **SMOTE** to balance classes  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating new meaningful features  
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Applied **Machine Learning models**:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  
     - XGBoost  
     - SVM  
   - Performance Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall  

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved high accuracy using **[best performing model]**  
- Comparative evaluation of different models  
- Insights into key factors affecting credit scores
